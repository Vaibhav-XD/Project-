# Capstone Diabetes Prediction Project

This is the repository for the Capstone Diabetes Prediction Project. The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a patient being diagnosed with diabetes based on various health-related features. This project was completed as part of the capstone project for [Your Institution/Organization Name].

## Project Description

In this project, we analyzed a dataset of health records of patients, which includes various features such as age, BMI, blood pressure, and glucose levels, among others. The dataset was preprocessed, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) was performed to gain insights into the data. Then, we developed a machine learning model using [insert name of machine learning algorithm(s) used], which was trained on a portion of the dataset and evaluated for its predictive accuracy using appropriate evaluation metrics. Finally, the model was used to make predictions on a test set, and the results were analyzed and interpreted.

## Project Features

- Data preprocessing: The dataset was cleaned, handled missing values, and transformed as needed.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): We performed EDA to gain insights into the data, including visualizations and statistical analysis.
- Machine Learning Modeling: We developed a machine learning model using [insert name of machine learning algorithm(s) used] to predict the likelihood of diabetes based on the given features.
- Model Evaluation: We evaluated the performance of the model using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Model Interpretation: We interpreted the results of the model predictions, including analyzing any patterns or trends observed.

## Project Files

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this project aimed to develop a machine learning model for predicting the likelihood of diabetes based on health-related features. The results obtained from the model evaluation indicate that the developed model shows promising predictive accuracy. However, further analysis and validation may be required before deploying the model in real-world applications.
